How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    had trouble with that, i still dont understand why.
    maybe i'll get better with practice.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it can save me a lot of time of searching for mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: less cluter, a better mind-set, ligical changes
    cons: human errors

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    maybe because the git system is more suitable to codding than google docs?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    i can save the "commits" with logical notes for each one and then view them in the git log and compare different ones with git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    cause i'll know that i can always easily find the bug and fix it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    learning javascript,html5,php,css,maybe java,maybe c++
